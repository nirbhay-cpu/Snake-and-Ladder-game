# Snake-and-Ladder-game
If you do fun with coding, then try this snake and ladder game<BR> 
In this, I explained that how you create snake and ladder game by using simple coding.<BR>
I have also add some sound for different purposes like for starting game , when player encounter any snake or ladder,etc.<BR>
Also,I have add voice to tell many things like where the player's token is or starting the game or many more.<BR>

For this game I have used three libraries:<BR>
1- random    : To generate random choice out of numbers or messages.<BR>
2- pyttsx3   : For converting text to Speech<BR>
3- playsound : For playing sound<BR>

NOTE:- I created this game for upto 20 only.If you want to increase you simply add list and replace 20 with the no. upto you want.<BR>
